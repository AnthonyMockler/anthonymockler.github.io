# Mansplaindex thoughts

* Need to account for the fact that there are more men than women 
* Also, do men speak more than women in general in Parl?
* Relevant measure: % of times you interrupt a woman as a % of your total interruptions?
* Or should it be how far you differ from the average of all people (men / women)


If mansplaining is real, then a woman in parliament should get interrupted a lot
