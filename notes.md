Hi, my name is Anthony.
When I was 7 years old I read *Last Chance to See* by Douglas Adams and I found out about the Kakapo
In 19XX, there were X Kakapo left in the world. I emptied my 'Buy Nintendo Games' piggy bank and sent it all to the Kakapo Recovery Fund. I went to school and convinced my classmates and teachers to donate hundreds more.
Now, because of me and tens of thousands of people like me, the Kakapo is the only bird ever to be removed from the endangered species list for the right reason.

Today, I'm a Political Data Scientist and Field Organiser. I've worked for:
Obama for America
Australian Conservation Foundation
GetUp
Australian Greens
Philippines Department of Interior & Local Government - Disaster Risk Reduction & Management
United Nations Pulse Lab

I've helped volunteer and professional campaigners change the course of political destiny.
I've helped change the way NGOs raise money online, gaining hundreds of thousands of dollars and thousands of new activists
I've designed and managed Online Advertising Campaigns in the 100s of thousands of dollars, and I've used those resources to meaningfully shift the outcome of elections. I've verified those results using Data, Analytics, Polling and focus groups.

Now, I'd like to do it for you.
